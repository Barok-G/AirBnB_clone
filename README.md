# AirBnB Clone ― The ALX-Holberton B&B
![Optional Text](hbnb.png)
## Description of the project
The ALX-Holberton B&B sums up the implementation of my four months of student at the ALX-Holberton School.
The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the AirBnB website ― which we call hbnb. The final version of this project have:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
- A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
- A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.

The project's implementation will happen in the following phases:

## Phase One
The first phase is to manipulate a powerful storage system to give an abstraction between objects and how they are stored and persisted. To achieve this, the author will:
- Create a data model
- Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console/command interpreter
- Store and persist objects to files (JSON files)
